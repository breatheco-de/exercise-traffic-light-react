# Traffic Light with React
<!-- endhide -->

Sometimes we want to create components with an internal state that changes over time. Imagine a traffic light that changes color every 3 seconds, for that we normally initialize a variable `color` and set it to a default color:

```js
let color = "blue";
```

But we want our component to re-render and change the website's HTML every time the variable `color` changes, that's why we use hooks:

```js
//        ‚Üì variable name              ‚Üì default value
const [ color, setColor ] = useState("red");
//               ‚¨Ü function to change the "color" variable
```

From now on, every time we use the function `setColor` to change the `color` variable, the component will re-render and the entire traffic light HTML will be updated with the new color.

## üå± How to start this project

Do not clone this repository because we are going to be using a different template.

We recommend opening the `react boilerplate` using a provisioning tool like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod). Alternatively, you can clone it on your local computer using the `git clone` command.

This is the repository you need to open or clone:

```

**üëâ Please follow these steps on** [how to start a coding project](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-start-a-project).

> üí° Important: Remember to save and upload your code to GitHub by creating a new repository, updating the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and uploading the code to your new repository using the `add`, `commit` and `push` commands from the git terminal.


## üìù Instructions

Let's simulate a traffic light [like this one](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-traffic-light-react/blob/master/preview.gif).

The light has to glow when clicked/active. Learn how to [create a glow effect with CSS](https://codersblock.com/blog/creating-glow-effects-with-css/).

- The whole purpose of the component is to display a traffic light with red, yellow and green lights.
- When any light is clicked (selected), it has to glow, but the other lights have to stop glowing.
- The component must have a hooked state variable that tracks the color:

```js
const [ color, setColor ] = useState("red");
```

- Use the `setColor` function to change the color, and the component will automatically re-render (because it's hooked with `useState`).
- Use the ReactDOM.render to render the component into the DOM, like this:
  
```js
ReactDOM.render(<TrafficLight />, document.querySelector('#app'));
```

## üî• Bonus

+ 2 Create one button that when you click on it, cycles the traffic light selected color between red, green and yellow.  
+ 10 Have a button that when clicked, it adds an extra color "purple" to the traffic light.
